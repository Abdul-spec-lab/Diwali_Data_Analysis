# Diwali_Data_Analysis
This project analyzes Diwali sales data retrieved from a CSV file. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook with Python. The dataset contains information about sales during the Diwali period, and the analysis aims to explore patterns, trends, and insights from this data.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a CSV file named `diwali_sales_data.csv`. It includes the following columns:
- **Date**: Date of the sale
- **Sales**: Sales amount for that date
- **Product**: Type of product sold
- **User_ID**: ID of the user/customer
- **Cust_name**: Name of the customer
- **Product_ID**: ID of the product
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Age Group**: Categorized age group of the customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Marital_Status**: Marital status of the customer
- **State**: State information
- **Zone**: Geographical zone
- **Occupation**: Customer's occupation
- **Product_Category**: Category of the product
- **Orders**: Number of orders made
- **Amount**: Sales amount
- **Status**: Status of the order
- **Unnamed1**: Additional column (if available)

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running Python code, data visualization, and analysis
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations and array manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Library for data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Library for data visualization
## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Loading the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Checking for missing values, handling inconsistencies, and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure, summary statistics, and initial insights.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, or pie charts to illustrate sales trends, popular products, or any other relevant patterns.
5. **Conclusions**: Summarize the findings and key insights obtained from the analysis.

## Files Included
- **diwali_sales_data.csv**: Raw dataset used for analysis
- **Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the analysis

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3. Open `diwali_sales_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis step-by-step.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Diwali sales data reveals insights into sales trends, popular products, and other patterns during the Diwali period. These findings can be used for strategic decision-making, marketing planning, or further business analysis.
